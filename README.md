This is intended as a drop in generic custom editor for invoking simple functions in editor. 

To use copy the MonoEditorDebug script into the project, make your desired class inherit from MonoEditorDebug 
and then add the EditorDebugMethod Attribute to the function you wish to add to the custom inspector. 

A test script and scene are included.
